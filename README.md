# Surfs Up!

---

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this analysis was to provide the new investors with the data they need make an informed investment decision. The money that they are willing to invest in the W. Avy's surf shop will be the only way the new surf shop will come into existence. The investors are not going to just hand over their hard earned money without knowing that we have done our homework and can provide data driven proof that the concept and the location of the surf shop has all the ingredients for success. They asked to see concrete evidence that the temperature and precipication are going to be ideal for the new shop. We have provided them with this data.

## Results

The first step was to determine what month had the most ideal combination of temps and rainfall. After extracting 12 months of data, it proved that June was the best month of the year. I used summary statistics to quickly evaluate all the data of for the months of June and December.

* Max temps: June's max temperature is 85 degrees whereas December's max is only 83 degress.

* Avg temps: June again wins with its average temp being warmer at 75 degrees, December only averages 71 degrees.

* Lowest Temps: Nobody enjoys a cool temperature while visiting the beach but June is still warmer at 64 degrees vs. December getting down to 56 degrees.

## Summary

With our abaility gather over 1500 datapoints for each month, can can without a doubt show that this is an ideal location for a new surf shop. The summaries are a quick visual that saves the time of the investors to pur through sreadsheets full of weather data. The data is able to show that taking a vacation to visit the shop will be a fun-in-the sun trip.

An additional query that could be leveraged would be to run the same analysis using different weather stations. There could possibly be an even more perfect location on the island to build the surf shop.

If the surf shop is also going to be selling ice cream then a more detailed analysis could be provided on the combination of rain and temps. Nobody wants to be eating ice cream if it's pouring rain. This analysis could show if maybe there should be certain months that either ice cream sales are not avaialble or which months should host ice cream sale specials due to little to no rainfall.
